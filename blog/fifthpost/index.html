			<h1>SCA Extension - Question Posed at ETS meeting on 17th of January 2023</h1>

<ul class="post-metadata">

</ul>

<p>On this latest ETS meeting I asked again about an extended Smoke Control Area.
A Labour Group amendment, backed by the Conservative party, voted to delay (or possibly prevent) an extended SCA.
What is the impact of this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>14% of the city suffer asthma.</p>
<p>Between 1/3 and half of all childhood asthma is caused by poor air quality (Bradford &amp; Barcelona studies).  Air pollution also causes heart disease, COPD, lung cancer, low birth weight, premature birth, dementia, organ damage and developmental problems.</p>
<p>38% of particulate emissions (UK) are from solid fuel burning (DEFRA)</p>
<p>Particulate pollution increased in Preston Park the last three years (AQASR).</p>
<p>A Labour Group amendment was submitted to the recent AQAP delaying a SCA extension and denying residents protection against the worst solid fuel pollution offences; will research into SCA extension be made a priority?</p>
