Some housing developments have worsened air quality by being sited close to busy roads, reducing air flow and exposing people to pollution and noise.  People, homes, cycle lanes & pavements should be distanced from roads.  Protective barriers could be created with trees and bushes.  New developments could provide new pollution free active travel routes.
