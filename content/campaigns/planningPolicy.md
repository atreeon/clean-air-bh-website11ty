# Change planning policy so new homes improve air quality

Some housing developments have worsened air quality by being sited close to busy roads, reducing air flow and exposing people to pollution and noise.  People, homes, cycle lanes & pavements should be distanced from roads.  Protective barriers could be created with trees and bushes.  New developments could provide new pollution free active travel routes.
