Brighton & Hove suffers from
<a href="{% getUrlLinkByKeySC collections.all, 'Pollution Targets' %}">high levels</a>
of fine particulte air pollution that causes us significant
<a href="{% getUrlLinkByKeySC collections.all, 'Health Impact' %}">ill health</a>.

One of the main sources of harmful fine particulate air pollution is
<a href="{% getUrlLinkByKeySC collections.all, 'Health Impact' %}">from burning coal and wood in open fires and stoves</a>.

A Smoke Control Area (SCA) is a legal designation that prohibits the emission of excess smoke from chimneys of buildings
thereby reducing air pollution and improving air quality.

Surprisingly, our city is the largest city in the country without a full Smoke Control Area (SCA).

We need full protection but the local Labour party has been against this simple and standard form of regulation and has seemed poorly educated on the subject of air pollution.

In an environment committee meeting in 2022 Labour created an amendment to purposefully derail a scoping exercise into a SCA extension and disrupt progress to clean our air.
Shockingly they told the committe that 'people should be able to burn what they like'.  We want Brighton & Hove Labour to change its position and support a full SCA and support clean air.

The current SCA covers just 7% of the city.
