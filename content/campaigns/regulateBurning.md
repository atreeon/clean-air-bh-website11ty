# Regulate coal and wood burning in the city

Burning causes air pollution.  Our city is the largest city in England without a full Smoke Control Area (SCA).  The current SCA covers just 7% of the city.

# Help!!! Delivering Mum's for Lungs Stop Wood Burning Leaflets

Please help us deliver leaflets.  Send us an email with your address and the number of flyers you think you can deliver.
It would be great if we could raise awareness on this issue by delivering flyers to
homes that look like they might still have a working chimney or wood burning.
We could also think about pining up the flyers in locations where they might be seen.
