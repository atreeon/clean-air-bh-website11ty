Brighton & Hove suffers from
<a href="{% getUrlLinkByKeySC collections.all, 'Pollution Targets' %}">high levels</a>
of fine particulte air pollution that causes us significant
<a href="{% getUrlLinkByKeySC collections.all, 'Health Impact' %}">ill health</a>.

One of the main sources of harmful fine particulate air pollution is
<a href="{% getUrlLinkByKeySC collections.all, 'Health Impact' %}">from burning coal and wood in open fires and stoves</a>.

A Smoke Control Area (SCA) is a legal designation that prohibits the emission of excess smoke from chimneys of buildings
thereby reducing air pollution and improving air quality.

Surprisingly, our city is the largest city in England without a full Smoke Control Area (SCA); we need one but the local
Labour party has been slow to act and has seemed poorly educated on the subject of air pollution.  In an environment
committee meeting in 2022 Labour created an amendment to purposefully derail the SCA extension and disrupt progress
to clean our air.

The current SCA covers just 7% of the city.
