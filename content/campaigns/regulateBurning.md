Burning causes air pollution.  Our city is the largest city in England without a full Smoke Control Area (SCA).  The current SCA covers just 7% of the city.

## Please send us an email if you'd like to help deliver Mum's for Lungs flyers

Please help us deliver leaflets.  Send us an email with your address and the number of flyers you think you can deliver.
Or just let us know and we can deliver some leaflets together.
It would be great if we could raise awareness on this issue especially in neighbourhoods
where burning coal and wood is popular.
