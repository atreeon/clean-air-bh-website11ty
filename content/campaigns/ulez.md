Brighton & Hove suffers from
<a href="{% getUrlLinkByKeySC collections.all, 'Pollution Targets' %}">high levels</a>
of Nitrogen Dioixide (NO2) gas and particulte air pollution that causes us significant
<a href="{% getUrlLinkByKeySC collections.all, 'Health Impact' %}">ill health</a>.

One of the major sources of both these pollutants is
<a href="{% getUrlLinkByKeySC collections.all, 'Health Impact' %}">transport related air pollution</a>, especially from
diesel vehicles.  The levels are much higher the closer to the pollution source we are.

An Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) is a legal designation that has been proven to reduce air pollution and improve air quality.

We would like our majority Labour led council to take air pollution seriously.  The only real way of proof, after many
disappointments, is by rolling out a ULEZ across the city.  Labour councillors have been, so far, slow to act.

### Other Cities
Bath, Bradford, Greater Manchester, Bristol, Inner London, Central London, Outer London, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield,
Southampton, and York have all announced ULEZs.  Brighton & Hove, with its high levels of air pollution, is lagging behind
both in terms of pollution and action.

### 'Existing' ULEZ
Many councillors have cited and existing ULEZ in Brighton & Hove.  This is not true.  The current ULEZ is not yet active.
It only comes into effect in 2024.  However, announcing a ULEZ is a good first step and actually helps to reduce air
pollution because vehicles choice is influenced by the announcement.

Surprisingly the 'existing' ULEZ only applies to buses. It does not apply to taxis, private hire vehicles, vans, lorries.
