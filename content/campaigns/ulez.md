Brighton & Hove suffers from
<a href="{% getUrlLinkByKeySC collections.all, 'Pollution Targets' %}">high levels</a>
of the harmful Nitrogen Dioixide (NO2) gas and particulate air pollution that causes us significant
<a href="{% getUrlLinkByKeySC collections.all, 'Health Impact' %}">ill health</a>.

One of the major sources of both these pollutants is
<a href="{% getUrlLinkByKeySC collections.all, 'Health Impact' %}">transport related air pollution</a>, especially from
diesel vehicles.  The levels are even higher the closer to the pollution source we are such as next to a road, in a cycle lane, by a bus stop or in a car.

A Clean Air Zone is a legal designation that has been proven to reduce air pollution and improve air quality.
It doesn't ban vehicles and only applies to the 10% most polluting of vehicles.
That small minority of vehicles are responsible for a very large proportion of the traffic related pollution.
They include petrol vehicles older than 2003 and diesel vehicles older than 2015.
Any money generated by a Clean Air Zone must, by law, be used to help clean up the air.

The local Labour party has majority control of Brighton & Hove council.  In the leadup to the elections in May 2022 they supported a
Clean Air Zone expansion with Cllr Miller at a transport hustings confirming that Labour would support a clean air zone.
In their manifesto they told voters they would "work to end noisy and polluting diesels".

Unfortunately as soon as they were elected they reversed their decision breaking an election pledge.  The council has no
other means of regulating vehicles entering our city other than by a Clean Air Zone.

We would like our majority Labour led council to take our health and air pollution seriously.
Labour councillors have so far been against the most effective ways of tackling air pollution.

### Other Cities
Bath, Bradford, Greater Manchester, Bristol, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield,
Southampton, and York have all announced Clean Air Zones.
The Low Emission Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zones in Inner London, Central London, Outer London are types of Clean Air Zones.


Brighton & Hove, with its high levels of air pollution, is lagging behind
both in terms of pollution, action and helping drivers prepare.

### 'Existing' ULEZ
Some people refer to an 'existing' ULEZ that operates in Brighton & Hove.
It only comes into effect in May 2024 applying only to one road and buses.

Taxis, private vehicles, vans and lorries can all operate the most polluting of vehicles.
Most worrying of all is that the zone is only voluntary; the buses, the only vehicle type "regulated", are free to completely ignore it.

Announcing a Clean Air Zone early is a good first step as the announcement itself reduces air
pollution because vehicle choice is influenced and drivers can prepare.

However, without a proper Clean Air Zone in place pollution will not be reduced sufficiently.

## What You Can Do to Help

## Will the proposed ULEZ affect you?

An independent study prepared by the council back in 2020 proposed a ULEZ expansion in order to meet air pollution guidelines for health.
It exempted residents until 2030 but the current Labour administration objects to even this mild version of a Clean Air Zone.

Without a full Clean Air Zone we cannot reduce air pollution sufficiently to meet guidelines limits for health.
