# Roll out an effective Clean Air Zone / ULEZ

Clean air zones are one of the most effective tools we have to improve air quality.  Brighton & Hove’s small bus only ULEZ (Ultra Low Emission Zone) doesn’t start until 2024.  It covers just a small section of road and only applies to buses.  It won’t improve illegally polluted areas where buses don’t go (eg Cheapside).
