  longTitle: Roll Out an Extended Clean Air Zone / ULEZ
  order: 1

Brighton & Hove suffers from
<a href="{% getUrlLinkByKeySC collections.all, 'Pollution Targets' %}">high levels</a>
of Nitrogen Dioixide (NO2) gas and particulte air pollution that causes us significant
<a href="{% getUrlLinkByKeySC collections.all, 'Health Impact' %}">ill health</a>.

One of the major sources of both these pollutants is
<a href="{% getUrlLinkByKeySC collections.all, 'Health Impact' %}">transport related air pollution</a>, especially from
diesel vehicles.  The levels are much higher the closer to the pollution source we are.

An Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) is a legal designation that has been proven to reduce air pollution and improve air quality.

We would like our majority Labour led council to take air pollution seriously.  The only real way of proof, after many
disappointments, is by rolling out a ULEZ across the city.  Labour councillors have been, so far, slow to act.

### Other Cities
Bath, Bradford, Greater Manchester, Bristol, Inner London, Central London, Outer London, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield,
Southampton, and York have all announced ULEZs.  Brighton & Hove, with its high levels of air pollution, is lagging behind
both in terms of pollution and action.

### 'Existing' ULEZ
Some people refer to an 'existing' ULEZ in Brighton & Hove.  The 'existing' ULEZ is not yet active.
It only comes into effect in 2024.  It also only applies to one short road and only applies to buses; taxis, private
vehicles, vans and lorries can all still use the most polluting vehicles without any restriction.

Announcing a ULEZ early is a good first step and actually helps to reduce air
pollution because vehicle choice is influenced by the announcement.

However without a proper ULEZ in place, with a full range of vehicles restricted, covering the whole city,
pollution will not be reduced sufficiently.  We need a full ULEZ.
