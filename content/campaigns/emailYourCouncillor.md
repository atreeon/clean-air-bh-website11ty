Our councillors make decisions that either help or hinder our efforts to improve air quality.

Why not write to your councillors and ask them to support clean air initiatives?

The council is majority Labour but all councillors can be contacted and can push for change.

Labour promised in their February 2023 local manifesto to “bring an end to noisy and polluting diesel vehicles” but we feel they aren't doing enough.

Why not ask them to honour their manifesto promises and introduce a Clean Air Zone like other councils?
Clean Air Zones are the most effective way to reduce harmful Nitrogen Dioxide pollution.

Or perhaps you could ask them to expand the Smoke Control Area to cover the whole of Brighton?
Did you know that the majority of the city is not protected by a Smoke Control Area
and Brighton & Hove is the largest city without a full Smoke Control Area in England?

Or perhaps you could ask why non compliant buses are still allowed to operate in the bus only voluntary ULEZ zones withou any penalty?
