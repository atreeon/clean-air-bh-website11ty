On this latest ETS meeting I asked again about an extended Smoke Control Area.
A Labour Group amendment, backed by the Conservative party, voted to delay (or possibly prevent) an extended SCA.
What is the impact of this?

> 14% of the city suffer asthma.
>
> Between 1/3 and half of all childhood asthma is caused by poor air quality (Bradford & Barcelona studies).  Air pollution also causes heart disease, COPD, lung cancer, low birth weight, premature birth, dementia, organ damage and developmental problems.
>
> 38% of particulate emissions (UK) are from solid fuel burning (DEFRA)
>
> Particulate pollution increased in Preston Park the last three years (AQASR).
>
> A Labour Group amendment was submitted to the recent AQAP delaying a SCA extension and denying residents protection against the worst solid fuel pollution offences; will research into SCA extension be made a priority?
