In Brighton & Hove, when we are on the bus entering North Street or Western Road
we hear the announcement that we are entering the ULEZ.

So do we already have a ULEZ in Brighton?

Unfortunately our ULEZ only applies to buses; not taxis, not lorrys, not vans and not cars.
Also, the ULEZ is voluntary.  So, if a bus operator wants to avoid the ULEZ charge they can.
They are not required to pay a charge and are still allowed to operate in the city.

Also, despite the ULEZ announcement on the bus, prior to 2024, the ULEZ was not in effect in Brighton.

The government have removed the option of voluntary ULEZs from the Clean Air Zone framework due to their ineffectiveness.
This is currently what is happening at the moment, non compliant buses are still allowed to operate within the boundary.

In effect, in Brighton, we have a ULEZ by name only and it is more about misleading people than actually reducing pollution.

Good work has been done by Brighton & Hove buses to

Voluntary ULEZ

Bus announcements

Buses only
Taxis, vans, lorries & cars
