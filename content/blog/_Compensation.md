Post office
Blood

In Brighton still trying to stop the harm
Is it me or how does the blood or the post office scandals differ?
We've known for many years AQ is bad for our health
harms our health and kills people early.

Professor Sir Stephen Holgate, 1 in 3 cases of asthma in Bradford

Culpability is one problem and shows how AQ is far more complicated

Is it congestion, road traffic, industry, wood burning, agriculture, shipping, aviation, rail, construction, dust, pollen, sea salt, volcanoes, Saharan dust, wildfires, indoor air pollution, air fresheners, cleaning products, candles, incense, cooking, smoking, vaping, heating, cooling
Are all the vehicles the same?
Which countries affect our AQ?

I feel it is the responsibility of the government to protect us from AQ
