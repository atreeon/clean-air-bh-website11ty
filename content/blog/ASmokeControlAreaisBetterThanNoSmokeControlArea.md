Brighton & Hove Labour seem to keep delaying, blocking and voting down a full Smoke Control Area (SCA).
Their recent reasoning is that it might not be effective enough to reduce pollution due to the low level of previous enforcement.
This is certainly an improvement to Cllr Appich's shocking previous announcement in 2022 that "people should be able to burn what they want".

An alternative to a SCA is to begin phasing out wood & coal as fuels for domestic heating nationally and I agree.
A complete phase out would be easier to enforce and would be justified.
In doing so we could reduce pm2.5 emissions by some 20 or 30%
which in cities could mean even larger reductions to exposure levels where it can hang round on cold windless evenings.
However Labour have failed to suggest any alternative plan to reduce PM2.5 from domestic solid fuel burning.

Poor Air Quality continues to be the biggest environmental risk to human health (EIC 2023) and contributes to poor health.
Improving our health and avoiding unnecessary suffering should be the goal.
We must reduce the amount of smoke we emit in order to reduce the amount of pollution we breathe in.

I admit that enforcement of SCAs has been almost impossible,
however key to this whole topic is that the SCA legislation was updated very recently in May 2022.
The 1993 Clean Air Act and the wording on SCAs was updated substantially in 2022 in order to tackle this exact problem with enforcement
and to make it easier for councils to improve air quality through SCAs.

The reason SCAs were not enforced in the past is because there was no clear legal strategy to enforcement.
Since the 2022 updates, the act provides a much clearer framework to enforcement moving the offence away from criminal and making it a civil debt.
This I understand makes it easier to issue fines and enforce.
The update creates a framework with huge detail helping councils with enforcement including liablilty, objections, notices, appeals, recovery.
It might take a while for councils to get the best out of the new legislation and make use of it
but I believe we should help in that effort and encourage councils to use this new framework.

SCAs I agree are not strict enough but they have been made more strict in the 2022 update,
for example one of a number of improvements reduces the maximum allowed output of a stove from 5 to 3 grams of smoke per hour.

In order to improve health, a complete phase out of wood & coal burning should be the long term goal.
However neither Labour nor Conservative parties have indicated they want to phase out wood & coal burning nationally.

Even if the political will was there it would take a long time for the legislation to pass,
I believe the Clean Air Act update took over two years so an update to phase out wood & coal burning could take even longer.

In the short term, especially in Brighton where only a tiny portion of the city is covered by a SCA (https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/sca/),
it is the only intervention our council has.

I can only conclude that a full Smoke Control Area is better than a tiny one.
I do agree SCAs won’t completely solve the problem,
for example a new lower limit of 3 grams per hour of smoke limit will still add pollution and harm us
but a SCA could help and should be a fairly inexpensive intervention.
People generally obey laws; if an SCA was brought in, the majority of people would stop burning in the most polluting ways
and one would expect that emissions would be reduced.

Considering that Brighton has the highest background particulate pollution and is the largest city without a full SCA one could assume there is a link.
My strong opinion is we should try a full smoke control area in Brighton urgently.

If the Labour and Conservative councillors who voted down SCAs in the past won’t introduce a full SCA
then they must provide a clear and workable strategy that will reduce wood & coal emissions;
currently we've been waiting on Labour fo nearly five years since the original question was put to them at committee
however the central idea here and my strong opinion is that in the short term and locally there is no other option but to expand, enforce the smoke control area and raise awareness.
