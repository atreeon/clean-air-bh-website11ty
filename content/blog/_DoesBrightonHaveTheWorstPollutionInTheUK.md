A number of reports have shown that Brighton & Hove has some of the worst pollution in the UK where does this information originate and is it correct?

The most accurate sensors that measure air pollution come from DEFRA.

Brighton & Hove has only one sensor that measures air pollution and it is located in Preston Park.
It is classified as an urban background sensor.

For the year 2023 it showed that Brighton & Hove had the highest background particulate pollution in England.
I believe this is the source of this claim.

There are also private sensors that individuals can buy and install in their homes.
These sensors are not as accurate as the DEFRA sensors.
However the data from these sensors is recorded and can be accessed by the public.
These sensors have also shown that Brighton & Hove has high levels of pollution.

There are other pollutants in Brighton & Hove measured by the same monitor such NO2 and Ozone.

For NO2 our sensor shows a 'low level' of background pollution compared to other cities in the UK.
However NO2 is much more prevalent next to roads and our sensor is not located next to a road.
However this 'low level' is still 50% above the WHO guidelines for health.
Other more manual sensors in the city, diffusion tubes, have shown much higher levels of NO2.
In 2019 a diffusion tube sensor in North Street showed levels of NO2 that were the worst in the south east region (excluding London)
showing pollution 600% the WHO guidelines for health.

For Ozone our sensor shows a value 15th out of the 26 AURN urban background sensors in the UK.
Ozone is a secondary pollutant and is not emitted directly but is formed in the atmosphere from other pollutants.
It is a problem in the summer months when sunlight and heat can cause it to form.

The Labour & Conservatives parties have blocked, ruled out, kept quiet or avoided questions about whether they will expand the Smoke Control Area in Brighton & Hove
or whether they will bring in a Clean Air Zone in the city to reduce NO2 pollution from old diesel vehicles.
In our opinion these two improvements would be the most effective way to reduce pollution in the city in a short amount of time.

However in 2021 Labour, with support from Conservatives, did show support for better monitoring of pollutants in the city.
Almost three years later and with a Labour council in power, we still have only one sensor in the city.
It is expected to see a rollout of these new monitors and the data they provide soon.
It will be very interesting
