Currently Brighton & Hove has some of the most polluted air in the UK.
What are the records of the different parties?

In other locations it is high levels of NOx emitted from diesel cars.

Some locations such as North Street this is high levels of NOx emitted from buses and taxis.
In other locations it is particulate matter from wood and coal burning.

How can we reduce it?
Clean Air Zone,


What are the most effective ways in which to reduce our air pollution exposure?



What did they promise?

What have they said whilst being in leadership for a year?

What have they done?

What have they not done?

So, we have come to expect politicians to spin, exagerate the truth and over promise a bit.
It's just a bit of harmless politics, right?

Well, no. Not when it comes to air quality.

Take an individual who has the opportunity to move to a new city.
They have a choice to set up a life in two cities.
Hard working family with young children.
One has below average air quality but the politicians have promised action.
They believe the politicians and move there.
However the politicians vote against the most effective measures to improve air quality and air quality worsens.
Their children become ill as a result and miss days in school and fall behind with their studies.

They keep saying no to every single method of cleaning the air.
This will delay and delays will cost lives.
