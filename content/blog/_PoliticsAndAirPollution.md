Public information is so important for vulnerable people in Brighton & Hove.
Individuals with respiratory conditions, the elderly and children are most at risk from air pollution
and they need accurate information on whether pollution will improve or worsen.

The Labour party won a huge majority in Brighton & Hove in 2023 and have now been in power for over a year.
A key manifesto pledge was to improve air quality in the city specifically stating they would "bring and end to noisy and polluting diesels in the city".
During the election campaign Labour said that a Clean Air Zone would not be taken off the table but they would need investment.

Government funds are available for Clean Air Zones and the Labour party have not applied for any of this funding.
I see this as a broken manifesto pledge and a failure to act on a key election promise.

The Labour party have also failed to expand the Smoke Control Area in the city.

During a recent council meeting, the Cllr Muten told the committee that there is a functioning and effective ULEZ in the city that charges buses and taxis.
However this is not true.
The ULEZ is voluntary and only applied to buses.
There is no charge for buses and taxis and no charge for vans, lorries or cars.
In fact the government have removed the option of voluntary ULEZs from the Clean Air Zone framework due to their ineffectiveness.

Over the years we've heard various claims.
Cllr Birgit Miller spoke for Labour over about clean air during the transport hustings but she was moved to another department as soon as Labour won the election.
New buses are fully electric when they are not.
That we will have a clean air zone by 2022.
We have a functioning ULEZ.
That a Smoke Control Area decision would be made soon (we are still waiting).
There will be a

None of the above have been actioned upon and, apart from the funding that the government have made available to the private bus company
to purchase cleaner diesel buses, there has been no action on air quality.

During the election we were told that the Labour party would act to improve air quality.
However all they have done so far is continue with the bus improvement plan that has been going on since 2019.

For those of us whose health depends on clean air honesty could make a big difference.
Many of us have made decisions on where to live, work and even holiday based on the action our politicians have promised.
If they had told us that they would not act on air quality we could have made different decisions such as move to a city with better air quality.

Implementation of these clean air

I urge Labour, who are set to control our city for the next four years, to act on their promises and improve air quality in the city.
An alternative would be to be honest with the public and tell us how exactly they will bring an end to diesel and improve air quality.

I believe it is a failure of democracy when politicians do not act on their promises and more important dangerous
to our health as we rely on those pledges.
