Valley Gardens part three.

(insert image)

Firstly, I have only looked at the designs for an hour or two
and a more thorough examination might find more wrong with the designs.

During the Green Party's short minority administration in power in Brighton & Hove
which was defined by Labour & Conservatives voting against their plans at every opportunity,
especially on the subject of clean air and active travel infrastructure,
these schemes were critised for worsening air quality.

There are a number of ways of looking at air quality.
I like to define any improvements in Reduce, Distance and Protect.

So, are the proposed designs better or worse?
1. Does the new Valley Gardens design reduce the total amount of pollution emitted from transport?
One area that does increase emissions is congestion and inefficient driving.
So many different aspects of a design can influence air pollution.


3. Will congestion be improved or made worse?
I can see only a minor reduction in road space with the eastwards Marine Parade being cut down from two lanes to one a short while after the junction.
This road often has cars parked on the road blocking that second lane.
However there are other Only a good transport model can predict this.

- Will more people switch from driving or taking the bus; I think this will almost certainly have a significant switch as cycling will be an option where previously it wasn't.  I'd hope this would have a positive impact on reducing congestion as hopefully fewer people will drive or take the bus.  How much will that be?  Perhaps Valley Gardens 2 might provide an insight.  Will it offset any reduction in traffic flow?  Again we would need a transport model to answer this.

2. Distance & reduce exposures?
- For cyclists they will be distanced from the road and their emissions reduced considerably.  The current design is horrible and I am always fearful of breathing in pollution on this stretch as there is no cycle lane.  I currently cycle through the park albeit at walking pace!
- For pedestrians there will also and generally be an increase in distancing from traffic.
- currently the refuge areas between the lanes seem to be reduced so pedestrians will be stuck between the five lanes when crossing, these should be improved

3. Vulnerable?
- Levels of NOx on Edward Street are still around 4x WHO levels.  This is crazy as it would be the main walking route to the hospital.  Would any increase in congestion at the roundabout lead to an increase of pollution here?

What more could be done
1. Reduction of Emissions:
- A strong Clean Air Zone would of course mitigate any increase in emissions; this is how London's emissions have reduced even though congestion has increased.
- A move from buses to trams (NOx, particulates from tyre & road wear, CO2 due to 3x efficiency improvements, no batteries, per passenger use up much less road space, per vehicle use less road space due to sticking to a track, better for cyclists, pedestrians, public transport users)
- Fewer buses, fewer taxis - ie remove the taxi rank from such a central area where transport infrastructure is so important
- An open look at the new housing developments that cause increases in population in B&H.  There was a recent report that strongly suggested that population density is possibly the biggest offender when it comes to air pollution.

2. Distance & reduce exposures?
- a further increase in provision for walking & cycling such as a more direct cycle route that goes in a straight line and avoids a significantly inefficient bend the Valley Gardens
- better traffic lights management
- add green infrastructure between curb and cycle & pavement to trap particulates and creating a barrier for pollutants
- reduction of waiting time at lights for pedestrians, cyclists as these are the most polluted spots

3. Vulnerable?
- make Edward Street / Eastern Rd a Zero Emission Zone for taxis & buses (not geofenced) to mitigate any increase for hospital patients.  Something really needs to be done about this road right now regardless of Valley Gardens.

As someone who chooses to cycle when travelling to this location I am generally very much in favour due to the awful cycling infrastructure of the current and I personally don't want to be too critical as a result.  After New England Street I'd say it is the worst spot to cycle in the city.

If I do have an overriding concluding thought it is that we need a Clean Air Zone.  I think the council and especially Labour have been negligent in not bringing pollution and NOx down quick enough.  I remember when I listened in to the Ella Kissi Deborah's inquest (private) it was very similar to hearing Paula Vennells talk at the public Post Office inquiry - they knew, lied, kept it quiet in order to protect their brand and interests favouring their sponsors, own egos and jobs.  Most urgently, much much much more needs to be done right now, including announcing a Clean Air Zone and a Smoke Control Area.

Again, I am generally in favour of the Valley Gardens project but I'll let others talk about the specifics.

Kind Regards and wishing you all the best in getting the best designs and solutions for all.
