There are different types of air pollution and they have different impacts on our health.

### Particulate Matter (PM)
Particulate Matter (PM) are small particles that can be inhaled and cause us poor health.

They have been associated with asthma, lung cancer, respiratory diseases like silicosis, cardiovascular disease,
premature delivery, birth defects, low birth weight, developmental disorders, neurodegenerative disorders mental
disorders, and premature death.

### Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
Nitrogen dioxide is an irritant that causes pulmonary diseases
such as obstructive lung disease, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and sometimes acute exacerbation of COPD
and in fatal cases, deaths.

Often NO2 is used as a proxy for other pollutants, such as particulate matter, that are not measured as frequently.
