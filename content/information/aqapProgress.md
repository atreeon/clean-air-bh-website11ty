  longTitle: How Much Progress Has Been Made on the City's Air Quality Plan?
---

Brighton & Hove City Council agreed a number of initiatives that will improve air quality in the city.

It is important these actions are carried out quickly and the most effective measures are not delayed.

The expanded ULEZ and the Smoke Control Area are the most effective but very little progress has been made on these.
In fact, the Labour Party derailed the progress of the Smoke Control Area in a meeting in 2022.
