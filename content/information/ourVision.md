Air pollution is a public health crisis and our elected representatives are not doing enough to tackle it.
Polluted air is linked to asthma, heart disease, strokes, dementia, diabetes, cancer and reduced life expectancy.
<br /><br />
Air pollution is particularly harmful to children and babies.  It can cause asthma, stunt lung growth and reduce life expectancy.
<br /><br />
It is the top environmental risk to human health in the UK.
Brighton & Hove has some of the UKs most polluted roads and, due to a lack of regulation, we are one of the least protected from poor air quality in the UK.
<br /><br />
We are campaigning for clean air for everyone, please join us.
<br /><br />
The red on the map shows illegal levels of pollution.  Let's clean up the air!
