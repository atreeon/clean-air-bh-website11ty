		<title>A Full Smoke Control Area Is Better Than a Tiny Smoke Control Area</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Brighton &amp;amp; Hove suffered the highest background particulate pollution in 2023 in England according to DEFRA monitors
and our city is the largest without a full Smoke Control Area (SCA).
However Brighton&#39;s Labour group seems to continue to delay, block and object to an expansion of our small SCA.
Their recent defence is that it might not be effective enough to reduce pollution due to the low level of previous enforcement.
This is certainly an improvement to Cllr Appich&#39;s shocking justification for blocking the expansion in 2022; &amp;quot;people should be able to burn what they want&amp;quot;
but this latest response still falls short as it ignores the 2022 update of the Clean Air Act that improves enforcement and the fact SCAs, even when not enforced, act as a deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cleanairbh.com/img/SCA/SCA_Brighton.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative to a SCA is to begin phasing out wood &amp;amp; coal as fuels for domestic heating nationally and I agree.
A complete phase out would be easier to enforce and would be justified.
In doing so we could reduce pm2.5 emissions by some 20 or 30%
which in cities could mean even larger reductions to exposure levels where it can hang around on cold windless evenings.
However neither Labour nor Conservatives support phasing it out and have failed to suggest any alternative plan to reduce PM2.5 from domestic solid fuel burning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor Air Quality continues to be the biggest environmental risk to human health (EIC 2023) and contributes to poor health.
Improving our health and avoiding unnecessary suffering should be the goal.
We must reduce the amount of smoke we emit in order to reduce the amount of pollution we breathe in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cleanairbh.com/img/SCA/SCA_North.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government admitted that enforcement of SCAs was almost impossible and have finally acted.
The 1993 Clean Air Act and the wording on SCAs was updated substantially in 2022 in order to tackle this exact problem
and to make it easier for councils to improve air quality and enforcement through SCAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason SCAs were not enforced in the past is because there was no clear legal framework to enforcement.
In the 2022 update, the act provides a much clearer framework to enforcement, moving the offence away from criminal and making it a civil debt.
This I understand makes it easier to issue and recover fines.
The update creates a framework with good detail that specifies how to deal with liablilty, objections, notices, appeals and recovery.
It might take a while for councils to get the best out of the new legislation and make use of it
but I believe we should help in that effort and encourage councils to use this new framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cleanairbh.com/img/PM25_Health.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCAs I agree are not strict enough but they have been made more strict in the 2022 update,
for example one of a number of improvements reduces the maximum allowed output of a stove from 5 to 3 grams of smoke per hour.
This is still too much but currently, in Brighton where the majority of us are not protected by a SCA, there is no limit at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to improve health, a complete phase out of wood &amp;amp; coal burning should be the ultimate and urgent goal
but as neither Labour nor Conservative parties have indicated they want to phase out wood &amp;amp; coal
the only intervention we have is to expand and properly enforce our SCAs.
Currently Labour and Conservative councillors seem to be blocking this intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cleanairbh.com/img/SCA/SCA_Crawley.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cleanairbh.com/img/SCA/SCA_Bristol.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the political will was there it would take a long time for the legislation to pass,
for example the 2022 update I believe took over three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short term, especially in Brighton where only a tiny portion of the city is covered by a SCA (https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/sca/),
it is the only serious intervention available to our council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect Labour&#39;s next delay would be to suggest that we should wait to see if the new legislation works before expanding SCAs.
I don&#39;t understand what this would achieve other than provide further delays.
People generally obey laws;
if a full SCA was brought in, the majority of people would obey that law and stop burning in the most polluting ways
and one would expect that emissions would be reduced.
A minority would continue but the situation overall would be improved and we do have the new enforcement framework to assist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cleanairbh.com/img/SCA/HeatingOptions.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the SCA didn&#39;t work for the whole city it might provide assistance to vulnerable individuals
who are suffering a steady stream of smoke entering their property.
This I believe is justification enough to expand the SCA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An expanded Smoke Control Area to cover the whole of Brighton would be more effective than a tiny one and I urge our council to take the action required without any further delay.
We will support them in this.
I do agree SCAs won’t completely solve the problem but they will surely help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Labour and Conservative councillors who voted down SCAs in the past won’t introduce a full SCA
they must provide a clear and workable strategy that will reduce wood &amp;amp; coal emissions;
currently they are failing on this and have been failing for nearly five years since our original question was put to them at committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My strong opinion is that in the short term, locally, as well as raising awareness, there is no other option but to expand and enforce the smoke control area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good health to you all!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Necessary Interventions to Improve Air Quality - Local Election 2023</title>
		<link href="https://cleanairbh.com/blog/electionWants/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My need to campaign for clean air began when I accepted the evidence that my asthma is made worse and even caused by the poor air quality I have been exposed to.  The medical evidence for this link is well documented by organisations such as the World Health Organisation, British Medial Association and Public Health England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seriousness of my own lung disease has placed me in hospital a number of times with my life put at risk.  Obviously I need and want clean air for myself but I also want it for the thousands of others whose health is adversely affected by poor air quality.  Fortunately our city can make changes that will improve our air quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diseases that are known to be caused, worsened or linked to air pollution include dementia, asthma, complications in pregnancy, mental health, lung cancer, diabetes, heart disease, respiratory infections and shorter lives.  These are common diseases of course that can affect us and our loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City walkers, bus passengers, those waiting at taxi ranks, cyclists, residents, city workers and even motorists with young children on board are exposed to levels of pollution that can cause significant harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try my best to focus less on party politics and more on the mechanisms that can improve air quality and spread awareness.  However it is now local election time and it is important our new and re-elected councillors understand the best ways to improve air quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key principles to improving air quality are: Reduce - emissions, Extend - the distance between the source of pollution and us &amp;amp; Protect - vulnerable people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air pollution is above World Health Organisation guideline levels everywhere in our city.  On the most polluted roads pollution remains at illegal levels and over four times WHO guideline levels for health despite the latest data available (2021) having lower levels of traffic due to covid restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst performing measurements include Lewes Road, Hollingbury Road and North Street; all violating UK legal limits.  Many of these roads are not just central ring roads like in other cities with the odd home but these are key active travel routes, the main walking routes for pupils making their way to school, locations for clinics and pharmacies and are homes to thousands of residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will not be an easy task to improve air quality to the level the WHO recommends; it would require a reduction on these worst performing roads of over 80%.  My feelings though are clear that every effort should be made to improve air quality quickly and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can be done in our city to improve air quality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ULEZ (Ultra Low Emission Zone) is one of the most effective ways to improve traffic related air quality and only affects a small percentage of vehicles whilst avoiding an outright ban.  London’s air quality improved by up to 44% after just a few years in central London and is currently expanding its zone from central and inner London to the whole of the city.  I don’t want their dirty vehicles sold on the cheap to our city polluting us further; I want the same protection.  Without a ULEZ our city will continue to be a polluted one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The residential burning of wood and coal has increased over recent years.  Solid fuel burning is now responsible for 17% of total UK particulate emissions.  B&amp;amp;H is the largest city in England without a full Smoke Control Area to protect its residents.  Not having a full area is a very unique position for a city with the population density of Brighton &amp;amp; Hove.  Labour and Conservatives recently voted to delay expanding to a full zone even though a zone would continue to allow residents to use their burners but only require less polluting types of fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrifying the public transport network should also be a key focus.  All the city’s double decker buses are fueled exclusively by diesel (contrary to misinformation, none can be plugged in to charge; even the newest double deckers are fueled only by diesel).  Less than 1% of taxis are fully electric, 75% of taxis are diesel with around 20% of those diesels non ULEZ compliant.  As Sir Chris Whitty said in his annual report; harmful pollution from tyre and road wear would persist even with a fully electric transport network.  Trams are three times more efficient than electric buses with hydrogen being the least efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycling and walking are effectively pollution free modes of travel; it should be made safe and the routes pollution free.  One way of achieving this is to build out the pavement to increase the distance between us and the source of the pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New homes have been built on the most polluted roads in the city exposing new residents to harmful levels of pollution and restricting air dispersal (Hollingbury Road, London Road &amp;amp; Lewes Road developments).  Some developments have replaced nature lined clean air walks, with car parks and roads (Moulsecoomb Hub) or have not taken advantage when straightforward opportunities to improve walking and cycling routes exist (Moulsecoomb Place).  Is it time to strengthen the city plan to ensure developers better meet their clean air and active travel responsibilities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely, the right to an environment that does not harm us should be a priority.  In 2022 Green, Labour, Conservative and Independent councillors did agree to reduce air pollution in the latest five year air quality plan which was encouraging but without the necessary interventions required we in Brighton &amp;amp; Hove will continue to breathe polluted air.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Is it Time for Clean Air Taxi Incentives?</title>
		<link href="https://cleanairbh.com/blog/cleanTaxiIncentives/"/>
		<updated>2023-02-22T00:00:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;23% of all the taxis in our city are of the age, manufacturer and fuel type (diesel) associated with the VW emissions scandal.
As a result, these vehicles are much more likely to emit more pollution than other vehicles.
The more pollution we are exposed to, the more damage it will do to our health.
Even though these vehicles may be newer and have the euro 6 standard stamp of approval,
they will likely perform worse than intended; these vehicles are defective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that owners who have been mis-sold these poorly performing vehicles can claim large amounts of money back from the manufacturer.
The manufacturers agreed to settle a group claim and pay compensation to the owners of these vehicles.
Almost £200 million has already been paid out.
If a product causes harm we cannot reasonably expect the product to remain in use, especially when those who are harmed by the defective product are not able to avoid the harm.
This is a shame for both those exposed to poor air quality and the drivers but the drivers have accepted a compensation settlement.
Some recent studies have shown that somewhere between a third and a half of all childhood asthma cases in cities are caused by being exposed to high levels of pollution.
It is absolutely vital to improve the air quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxi drivers on average drive around 20,000 miles per year with some reaching up to 40,000.
Those miles will usually be driven inside the city right next to the places where we spend long periods of time.
These locations, where we spend the majority of our time, are the areas that we need to concentrate on most in order to clean up our environment.
Vehicles that fail emission testing shouldn&#39;t be driven next to our schools, bus stops, hospitals, doctor&#39;s surgeries, pharmacies, homes and parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some european countries have banned these vehicles in parts of their cities.  They deemed the harm they cause unacceptable.
However I feel our city will continue to be slow to react to the health harm these vehicles cause.
While we continue to wake up to our slow acknowledgement these vehicles do cause us ill health, in the meantime, I feel we should at least provide incentives to drivers to clean up these vehicles.
Grants and reduced licence fees for cleaner vehicles could easily be rolled out by our local council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Cambridge (and other cities), the incentives are provided by cheaper license fees.
The different categories being electric, euro 6 and older vehicles.
To preserve council financial accounts, when reducing license fees, some of the lost revenue could be switched to those with older vehicles.
Cambridge actually offers their electric vehicle licenses for free.
It is my opinion we could do this in Brighton &amp;amp; Hove right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council could go further still by awarding grants to upgrade vehicles.
In fact Uber corporation help drivers save money for vehicle upgrades by automatically creating a savings pot by taking a small percentage from their taxi fares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxi drivers are exposed to some of the highest levels of pollution of all city workers because they spend hours in traffic,
waiting regularly at taxi ranks near idling engines and rarely spend time away from these polluted environments.
When talking about cleaning up the air we often talk about protecting the most vulnerable such as children, the elderly and those with existing health conditions.
However it is also important to think about reducing the exposures of those who likely breathe in the most pollution; taxi drivers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bus operators have been forced to upgrade their fleet due to the ULEZ on North Street and Western Road.
The ULEZ applies to only buses with taxis unaffected.
Many of the upgrades to the bus fleets will have been paid for by passenger fares.
If the poorest and more efficient transport users can afford to upgrade to cleaner vehicles and taxi drivers in other cities (and countries) continue to upgrade
at a faster rate, surely it is time to introduce some incentives as a matter of priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air pollution causes significant ill health to tens of thousands of Brighton &amp;amp; Hove residents and it is time we took the steps to improve lives.
People should walk, cycle, e-cycle, take a train or possibly a bus to get around the city but, now that drivers have settled on compensation, the remaining taxis still in demand inthe city should be upgraded as quickly as possible to avoid causing any more harm to the drivers themselves and those others around the city.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>SCA Extension - Question Posed at ETS meeting on 17th of January 2023</title>
		<link href="https://cleanairbh.com/blog/scaExtension/"/>
		<updated>2023-01-17T00:00:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On this latest ETS meeting I asked again about an extended Smoke Control Area.
A Labour Group amendment, backed by the Conservative party, voted to delay (or possibly prevent) an extended SCA.
What is the impact of this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14% of the city suffer asthma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 1/3 and half of all childhood asthma is caused by poor air quality (Bradford &amp;amp; Barcelona studies).  Air pollution also causes heart disease, COPD, lung cancer, low birth weight, premature birth, dementia, organ damage and developmental problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;38% of particulate emissions (UK) are from solid fuel burning (DEFRA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particulate pollution increased in Preston Park the last three years (AQASR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Labour Group amendment was submitted to the recent AQAP delaying a SCA extension and denying residents protection against the worst solid fuel pollution offences; will research into SCA extension be made a priority?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
