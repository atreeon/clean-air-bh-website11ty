		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On this latest ETS meeting I asked again about an extended Smoke Control Area.
A Labour Group amendment, backed by the Conservative party, voted to delay (or possibly prevent) an extended SCA.
What is the impact of this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14% of the city suffer asthma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 1/3 and half of all childhood asthma is caused by poor air quality (Bradford &amp;amp; Barcelona studies).  Air pollution also causes heart disease, COPD, lung cancer, low birth weight, premature birth, dementia, organ damage and developmental problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;38% of particulate emissions (UK) are from solid fuel burning (DEFRA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particulate pollution increased in Preston Park the last three years (AQASR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Labour Group amendment was submitted to the recent AQAP delaying a SCA extension and denying residents protection against the worst solid fuel pollution offences; will research into SCA extension be made a priority?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
