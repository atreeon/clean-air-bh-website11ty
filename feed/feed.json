			"content_html": "<p>On this latest ETS meeting I asked again about an extended Smoke Control Area.\nA Labour Group amendment, backed by the Conservative party, voted to delay (or possibly prevent) an extended SCA.\nWhat is the impact of this?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>14% of the city suffer asthma.</p>\n<p>Between 1/3 and half of all childhood asthma is caused by poor air quality (Bradford &amp; Barcelona studies).  Air pollution also causes heart disease, COPD, lung cancer, low birth weight, premature birth, dementia, organ damage and developmental problems.</p>\n<p>38% of particulate emissions (UK) are from solid fuel burning (DEFRA)</p>\n<p>Particulate pollution increased in Preston Park the last three years (AQASR).</p>\n<p>A Labour Group amendment was submitted to the recent AQAP delaying a SCA extension and denying residents protection against the worst solid fuel pollution offences; will research into SCA extension be made a priority?</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
